Our shoes are collected from a number of sources - schools, podiatrists, shoe stores, gyms, churches, individuals etc. We are always looking to expand our network so please contact us if you are interested in collecting shoes for us. Only <b>SPORTS SHOES</b> please!   

Please see below for shoe drop-off points where you can donate your shoes and feel free to contact them for information on their opening hours.

If there are no Shoe Collector locations in your area please contact us for further info.

We have 2 types of shoe collectors:
<ul>
<li><b>CONTINUAL BASIS</b> - please email us for the Shoe Collector info pack.</li>
<li><b>SHOE DRIVE</b> (a once-off event) – for <b>CORPORATIONS, SCHOOLS</b> and <b>ORGANISATIONS</b>.  Please be aware that we ask for a <b>GOLD COIN DONATION</b> for each pair of shoes collected. We can issue a tax-deductible receipt for the funds collected. Please contact us before you start your Shoe Drive.</li>
</ul>

Please see <a href='http://www.shoesforplanetearth.com/about-us/soul-journey/'>‘Soul Journey‘</a> for information on the quality of the shoes we accept and how to clean and prepare them us.
